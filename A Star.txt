The A* algorithm is a pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm. It is widely used in games and navigation systems to find the shortest path between two points while avoiding obstacles.

It combines:
- Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (for shortest path)
- Greedy Best-First Search (for heuristic-based exploration)

The formula used is:
plaintext
F = G + H

- G = cost from start to current node
- H = estimated cost from current node to goal (heuristic)
- F = total estimated cost of the path through the current node
